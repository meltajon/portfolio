As a holiday tradition, I'd spend 3-4 weeks photoshopping hundreds of Santa Hats, fake snow, and even ugly Christmas sweaters on the profile pictures of hundreds of friends. To make it viral and spread as much holiday spirit as possible, I posted their pictures on their Facebook walls and tagged them for maximum exposure.

This was a huge hit not only for my friends, but for all of their Facebook friends as well.

In six holiday seasons, I made over 2,600 Santa Hats.
