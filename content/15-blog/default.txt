Title-public: My Blog

Text: 

I casually maintain a personal blog for expressing my thoughts that can't fit in 140 characters. My blog posts are mainly about technology trends, user experience design, and anything that inspires me.

I also use it as my web development playground to test bleeding edge front-end techniques that I otherwise would not be able to implement on any of my work.
