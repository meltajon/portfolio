As the Executive Producer and Co-Organizer of my summer concert, The Featured Acoustic Playlist, I led a team of 120 that brought together some of YouTube's most influential musicians from all around the nation for a huge concert…two years in a row.

Performers I worked with include: Andrew Garcia (American Idol Top 9) • Ramiele Malubay (American Idol Top 9) • Joseph Vincent (Ellen Show Musical Guest) • Alyssa Bernal (now signed under Pharrell) • Timothy DeLa Ghetto (1.1+ million YouTube Subscribers) • AJ Rafael (390,000+ YouTube Subs) • Cathy Nguyen (270,000+ YouTube Subs) • Victor Kim (America's Best Dance Crew Champion) • Lydia Paek (America's Best Dance Crew Finalist) • Sam Hart (Writer of "Mario Kart Love Song")

Our attendance was 1,100 for both years. I was in charge of all social media (Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr, BlogTV), online marketing, YouTube audition contest, and collaborating with influential YouTube personalities to promote the concert.
