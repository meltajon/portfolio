Text: 

I am a Front-End Developer with experience in HTML5, CSS3, PHP, MySQL, Wordpress, jQuery, Javascript, Git, SVN, mobile responsive design, and progressive enhancement.

But as an underlying foundation for all of that, I am a solutions-oriented thinker who is fascinated by the human side of technology. I constantly seek understanding of great user experience design and I am driven to build things that resonate with real people. 

I don't just build pages for sites. I craft solutions and systems for people, enabling them to work smarter, not harder.

My passion for the human side of technology is what drives me to write beautiful code. When I code, my focus is not on just *what* I am building, but *who* I am building it for.
