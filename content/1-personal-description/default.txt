Text: 

I am fascinated by the human side of technology. I constantly seek understanding of people with new technology and helping them when their expectations are not met. The most fulfilling feeling for me is when I build something that resonates with real people.

I’m driven by streamlining/redesigning everything so people can work smarter, not harder. I see constraints as opportunities to be creative.

My passion for understanding the human side of technology is what drives me to write beautiful code. When I’m coding, my focus is not on just *what* I am building, but *who* I am building it for.
