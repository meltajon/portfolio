At Pringo, we developed a social networking platform that allowed other companies to create their own Myspace (back when Myspace was bigger than Facebook).

As the first hired employee of Pringo out of 40, I was tasked with wearing multiple hats. In addition to building social networks for our clients, I was the lead product designer for the platform. These screenshots are the early designs of the administration control panel.
