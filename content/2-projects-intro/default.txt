Text: 

This is a sample of the projects I've worked on in the last nine years.

For a majority of my career, my projects have been in client services. But for the past couple years, Iâ€™ve been honing my skills to evolve from an agency developer to being an in-house developer, allowing me to dedicate more time to measure, validate, and optimize all design decisions.

I enjoy working with designers and fellow developers who understand and appreciate great user experience.
