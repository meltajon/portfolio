Text: 

This is a sample of the projects I've worked on in the last nine years.

For a majority of my career, my projects have been in client services. But for the past couple years, Iâ€™ve been expanding my front-end development skills so I can dedicate more time to measuring, validating, and optimizing all design decisions.

I enjoy working with people who value and prioritize great user experiences.
