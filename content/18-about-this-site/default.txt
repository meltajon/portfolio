Title-public: About This Site

Text: 

This portfolio site was built in less than 32 hours using PHP, <a href="https://www.getkirby.com">Kirby</a>, SASS, Media Queries, and reusable code from three of my current projects.

Each section is considered a module in the Kirby CMS. Each module is able to have its own CSS. To optimize for load time, I have all critical above-the-fold styling processed inline in the header HTML. While the user is reading everything above-the-fold, I then have the rest of the custom styling for each module loaded asynchronously.

Feel free to check out the source code for this site on GitHub.
